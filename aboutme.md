Hello!
I'm Navdha, a second-year undergraduate currently pursuing Engineering Physics with a math minor at IIT Bombay. This is where I'll write about anything that interests/concerns me, but I shall refrain from expressing strong opinions. I'm into reading, writing (you might see a lot of it here), art, and bad puns. 
I also take to care to not go out of touch with tech which is why I ever got to making this website in the first place. I might end up uploading some of the resources that you may find helpful. So while you're here, enjoy!
