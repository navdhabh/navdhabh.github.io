Hello! I'm Navdha, a second-year undergraduate currently pursuing Engineering Physics with a math minor at IIT Bombay. Though my friends would argue I'm boring, I tend to think of myself as a simple person with my own ideals that I remember to carry forward, even at times when it becomes too difficult. Besides math and physics, I'm into reading, writing (you might see a lot of it here), and art. I also take to care to not go out of touch with tech, which explains why I'm in the Mars Rover Team of the Institute, and which is also why I ever got to making this website. 

While you're here, enjoy!
