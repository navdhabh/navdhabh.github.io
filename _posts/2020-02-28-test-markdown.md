This was a reading project I did under the Summer of Science initiative by the Maths and Physics Club, IIT Bombay. Since it was one of my first reading projects in college, and I did not have any of the General Relativity background required for Cosmology and Dark Matter, my mentor provided me with the resources that did not require much of GR. This majorly included Prof Leonard Susskind's lectures and a chapter based on Cosmo from Caroll and Ostlie.

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.
