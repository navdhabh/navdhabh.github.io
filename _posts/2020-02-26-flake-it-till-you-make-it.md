In the summer of '22, I worked on Gaia Data Analysis under the guidance of a PhD mentor from IITB itself, along with 7 other students from different colleges across the country under the Krittika Summer Projects. This involved extracting data from ESA's Gaia Archive for specific classes of stars, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Galactic Centre; and using this data to plot HR Diagrams and other characteristic plots using Matlplotlib. The study was further extended to studying the physics of the stars and arriving at qualitative results.

Unfortunately, I do not have the github repository containing all the code, however, [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/104raWjxo9EZnPG4nwKAD3DOmlAc3EfIT/view?usp=share_link) is the link to our final report, which contains all the ADQL queries used to extract the data.
