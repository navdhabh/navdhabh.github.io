A very personal poem I wrote a while ago, The Temple.

“Will you come?”, he would ask me—my Grandpa,
every Tuesday, every Saturday,
“It’s Lord Hanuman’s day,” he would say,
“And you were born on a Saturday.”
Defiant and unruly and willful as I was,
I would nod in a game of pretend, 
submit only at the pact of shoulder rides,
for it was on reason that my head ever did depend
(and the Temple didn’t have quite)
I would acquiesce, and slyly twinkle
dreaming of ice-cream on the way back,
my agreement masked in an exultant jingle.

Even with my questionable faith firm and unyielding,
the Temple always did welcome with obscure delight,
the priest’s wife would sit in a sunlit corner,
greet Grandpa, and would modestly smile at the sight
of my sharp nose sincerely seeking, in hopes plain,
relishing the blessed fragrance of burning incense,
as my toes played in the patterns on the floor,
my fingers on the bright yellow walls in a peculiar pretense.

I wonder if she took the notice, and I think she did,
of my enigmatic leaning towards marigolds 
over roses, for she did always place one, perhaps a
 supplementary luxury, on my skirt’s soft folds.

After uncountable smiles exchanged, 
I still visit the temple, alone at ease,
or pass by, for it was on a Tuesday that
Grandpa died, and the woman is still there—
the priest’s widow—and I can only bend my knees, 
in righteous regard or in rusty reliance,
or perhaps out of forbidding fear, 
before Him, and still, remember to smile,
all the same, a faded smile withal I hold dear,
and I can only wonder, how long 
before she fades away along
into a dull beige like the Temple’s walls,
or jaded life, like Granny’s unvoiced calls
for a peaceful death, a death like Grandpa’s,
for he breathed his last on a Tuesday, 
and I, my first, on a Saturday,
and so I will smile, and smile 'til the close, be it in vain;
as in the pages of my diaries, among unfaded memories:
it is only the faded petals of a marigold that remain.
